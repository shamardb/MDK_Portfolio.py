#### Hi! I'm Shamar. I began my career as a Network Engineer, in 2015. Configuration of switches, routers, phones, Wireless Access points (and more) was the bulk of the job. Before that I was considered as the 'do-it-all' field IT admin for my Va Army National Guard units. I enojyed the congifguration process because it reminded me of my failed attempts to learn to code. The more I progressed in my carrer, the more automating tasks became a necessity. Eventually, automation became my favorite part of the job. Now, I am on a quest to transition from Network Engineering to Software Engineering. Here is a brief overview of my journey to get there!

#### Technical skills: Cisco products & devices, Microsoft Office, Python, Powershell, Bash

## Network Automation Experience 
- Senior Network Engineer @ Digital Realty (_April - _June 2023)
- Senior Network Engineer @ Verizon Business Group - MNSO (_March 2022 - _April 2023)
- Senior Network Engineer @ Defense Logistics Agency  (_December 2021 - _March 2022)
- Network Engineer @ Dept. of the Army; Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) -  (_October 2019 - _December 2021)


## Projects
#### These are some the projects I chose to facilitate my transistion from Network Engineering to Software Engineering.

### Poke_Coverage.py

In the game of Pokemon, a pokemon can be one or two of 18 unique types. This is their type combination.
 - There are 306/324 possible type combinations currently in use.
 - Each pokemon can attack with up to four moves.
 - Each move can be any type in the attackers move pool.
 - When pokemon attack using a move of the same type, they get a "Same-type attack bonus" or STAB, where (1.5)*DAMAGE is dealt.
 - Attack types can:
     - Be Super-effective (2.0 or 4.0*DAMAGE)
     - Be Resisted or 'Not very-effective' (0.5 or 0.25*DAMAGE)
     - Be an Immunity or Have 'no effect' (0*DAMAGE)

This project suggests 4 types to help users choose moves that will do the most damage to the most type combinations not covered by stab types. 
These moves are known as "coverage."
